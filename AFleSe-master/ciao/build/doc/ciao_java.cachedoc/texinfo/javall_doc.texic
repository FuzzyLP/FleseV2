@chapter Summary
@end ifnotinfo

This manual includes the complete reference to the low-level Prolog to Java interface. This interface allows a Prolog program to start a Java process and manipulate Java objects.

In this document we present an interface between Ciao Prolog and Java to take advantage of the capabilities of the java programming language, avoiding problems related to compile-time linking, system dependencies, and static references. This interface fully achieves the objectives using a simple but powerful protocol between both languages. The communication is established by means of sockets, allowing the processes to be in separated machines, and thus providing a means for distributed processing.
